    "Tarkovsky's Stalker was initially shot on Kodak 5247 stock. This film stock was newer to Soviet laboratories of the time, and some of the original negatives were destroyed by a processing error at the laboratory.

Asked about this, director Andrei Tarkovsky said 'no mother gives birth to the same child twice'.",
